# Initialize exchange
exchange = ccxt.binance({
    'apiKey': 'your_api_key',
    'secret': 'your_secret',
    'sandbox': True,  # Use testnet
})

# Create stop price calculator
stop_calculator = StopPriceCalculator(stop_loss_pct=2.0)

# Initialize position manager
position_manager = PositionManager(
    long_symbol='BTC',
    short_symbol='USDT',
    max_usd_pos=1000,
    stop_price_calculator=stop_calculator,
    gain_target_pct=3.0,
    exchange=exchange,

)

# Open a long position
position_manager.open_long_position()
```
